# Baseball-Data-Analysis
This project is an extension from DataCamp, using Statcast (which is a Major League Baseball data provider. It provides data points such as launch angle, speed, etc. I used python3 on jupyter notebook to analyse Stanton and Judge's home runs in the 2017 season. I look into their strengths and weaknesses are and how they differ in terms of styles for hitting home runs. After the analysis, I use a linear regression model to predict the distance the ball would travel given its launch angle and the velocity at which it leaves the bat.
