# Baseball-Data-Analysis
This project is an extension from DataCamp, using Statcast (which is a Major League Baseball data provider. It provides data points such as launch angle, speed, etc. These can be seen in the csvs uploaded to the repository). I used python notebook to analyse Stanton and Judge's home runs in the 2017 season. I look into where their strengths and weaknesses are and how they differ in terms of styles for hitting home runs.
